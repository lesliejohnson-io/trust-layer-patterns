            What a pattern means here
          </h2>
          <div className="prose">
            <p>
              A pattern is a named, reusable solution to a problem that keeps recurring — the same
              sense the term carries in software design. It is not a component, a guideline or a
              piece of advice. It has a name you can say out loud in a design review, a mechanism
              you can draw, and a set of conditions under which it applies and another under which
              it does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              What narrows this library is the second half: <strong>autonomy with physical
              consequences</strong>. Most AI pattern libraries cover AI inside software, where a bad
              output is a bad output. Here the machine moves, cuts, lifts or drives, so a
              miscalibrated handoff is measured in seconds and metres. That is why every pattern
              carries a risk and a reversibility, and why friction is sometimes the feature.

              I&apos;m Leslie Johnson, a product designer in Pittsburgh. My work has moved from
              interfaces to systems, and I&apos;m most interested in how people work alongside
              autonomous ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a university research lab, I designed software you could talk to. For a
              longitudinal health study, I designed a voice-enabled tablet from scratch that read
              each question aloud, so participants with low reading fluency could answer on their
              own. Then I watched field teams in rural Appalachia run the study, and redesigned
              their onboarding. At a payments company, I saw how students struggled to pay in
              distracting environments, and redesigned the flow to be as simple as autopay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the machines move. A car hands the wheel back at highway speed; a drone holds
              position until someone says go. The design of those moments is what this pattern
              library is about.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started this work as a deep dive into autonomous systems, and as a way to name and
              sort the patterns I&apos;ve uncovered. Patterns stay drafts until I find clear
              evidence, and the open questions on each page are ones I haven&apos;t answered yet.
