# Before — Before the machine acts, does the human agree?

Candidate patterns: Intent Preview, Capability Disclosure, Readiness Check
(Appropriate Friction already lives here.)

Research status key: **Ready** = incident, interface example and research all found. **Gap** = something still missing, listed under Open.

## Intent Preview — Ready

**Definition:** Before the machine acts, it shows the human what it is about to do (the path, the destination, the area it will sweep) so a wrong plan can be caught before it becomes a wrong action.

**Moment:** Before · **Trust job:** Know (sets up Intervene)

**Anti-pattern name:** Blind Execute. The system commits a plan the human never saw.

### Incident: American Airlines Flight 965, Cali, Colombia (1995)
- On a rushed approach, the captain entered "R" for the Rozo beacon. Rozo could only be reached by typing its full name; "R" selected the Romeo beacon near Bogotá, 132 nm away.
- The crew did not know the "R" on their chart (Rozo) was not the "R" they entered and executed (Romeo).
- The captain did not verify the provisional path on the FMS display or confirm it with the first officer before executing, in at least two separate cases.
- Investigators also cited FMS logic that dropped all intermediate fixes from the displays once a direct routing was executed, so the preview itself was degraded.
- The aircraft turned toward high terrain. 160 of 164 aboard died.
- Lesson drawn by investigators: when directing the FMS to a new waypoint, both pilots should confirm the airplane will head where intended before letting it command the turn.

### Interface example 1: Boeing MOD / EXEC loop
- A route change puts "MOD" in the page title, shows an ERASE prompt to discard it, and lights the white EXEC key.
- The proposed route appears as a dashed line on the navigation display; the pilot checks it for unexpected turns, loops or gaps.
- Nothing takes effect until the pilot presses EXEC. ERASE throws the proposed path away.
- Structure: staged plan → visible preview → explicit commit or discard.

### Interface example 2: Warehouse floor projection
- A robotic forklift (Örebro University) projects its intended trajectory onto the shared floor, plus lines marking the space the vehicle will occupy.
- Ratings from 13 test subjects improved clearly when intentions were projected.
- Related work found floor projection encourages people to choose an alternative, safer path.

### Research
- Walker, Hedayati, Lee & Szafir, "Communicating Robot Motion Intent with Augmented Reality," HRI 2018 (Best Paper). Four AR cues for a drone's flight path; NavPoints performed best and was most preferred.
- Chadalavada et al., "That's on my Mind! Robot to Human Intention Communication through on-board Projection on Shared Floor Space," ECMR 2015.

### Relationship to other patterns
Pairs with Appropriate Friction. Intent Preview answers "what is it about to do?"; Friction answers "how hard should it be to say go?" Boeing's EXEC loop does both; cross-link it from both pages.

## Capability Disclosure — Ready

**Definition:** Before the human hands over control, the system says what it can and cannot do, and where it is allowed to operate. Ideally it also refuses to engage outside those conditions rather than relying on a warning in the manual.

**Moment:** Before · **Trust job:** Know

**Anti-pattern name:** Fine Print Limits. The boundary exists only in the owner's manual, not in the system's behavior.

### Incident: Tesla Autopilot, Williston, Florida (2016)
- A Model S on Autopilot drove under a tractor-trailer crossing its path. Neither the system nor the driver braked.
- NTSB found the system's operational design permitted the driver's overreliance: it allowed prolonged disengagement and use inconsistent with Tesla's own guidance.
- The driver's pattern of use showed a lack of understanding of the system's limitations.
- Tesla's manual recommended Autopilot only on highways and limited-access roads, but the system did not enforce that.
- NTSB recommended that manufacturers build safeguards limiting automated control to the conditions it was designed for.

### Interface example: GM Super Cruise availability states
- The system only offers hands-free mode once it confirms conditions are right; the icon signals availability before the driver can engage.
- Hands-free is allowed only when the steering-wheel light bar is green.
- The limits are enforced by the system, not just stated.

### Research
- Amershi et al., "Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction," CHI 2019. Guideline 1: make clear what the system can do. Guideline 2: make clear how well it can do it, including how often it may make mistakes.

### Open
- Find a warehouse or industrial robotics example (e.g., an AMR that declares its operating zone or payload limits on the operator tablet).

## Readiness Check — Ready

**Definition:** Before and during supervised operation, the system confirms the human is actually able to supervise (looking, present, hands available) and escalates when they are not, instead of assuming a human in the seat is a human in the loop.

**Moment:** Before (continues During) · **Trust job:** Intervene

**Anti-pattern name:** Body in the Seat. Presence is treated as attention.

### Incident: Uber ATG, Tempe, Arizona (2018)
- An Uber test vehicle under automated control struck and killed a pedestrian at 39 mph.
- NTSB found the probable cause was the safety operator's failure to monitor the road and the automated system because she was visually distracted by her phone.
- Contributing: ineffective oversight of operators and no adequate mechanism to address automation complacency.
- Uber had cameras watching drivers but did not spot-check that they were paying attention.
- NTSB recommended testing applications require plans to manage operator inattentiveness.

### Interface example: GM Super Cruise Driver Attention System
- An infrared camera on the steering column tracks head position and eye movement.
- Escalation ladder: light bar flashes green → flashes red with chimes and seat vibration → voice prompt to take control.
- If the driver still does not respond, the system slows the vehicle to a stop.

### Research
- Lee & See, "Trust in Automation: Designing for Appropriate Reliance," Human Factors 2004.
- NTSB's own framing after Williston: humans are very poor at monitoring automated systems.

### Open
- Decide whether this belongs in Before, During, or a new "Setup" bucket (see the buckets question).
