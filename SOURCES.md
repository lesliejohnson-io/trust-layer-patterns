# Trust Layer Patterns — Sources

Paste each block into the matching pattern file's frontmatter, replacing `sources: []`.
Each `# comment` line explains what the source contributes to the pattern. YAML ignores comments, so you can keep them as notes for yourself.

Types follow the spec: `paper | standard | incident-report | article | talk`.
Incident reports are also strong **Observed** examples for the "In the field" section.

> Before publishing, read at least the abstract and the relevant section of each source. These were selected by topic fit and checked to exist; their specific claims have not been verified for you. Some links go to paywalled publisher pages. Where an open PDF exists, that's the link used.

## Notes for the library

- **Cross-pattern sources.** SAE J3016, UN R157, Norman 1990 and AF447 each support two patterns. That overlap is useful evidence for your Related patterns section: the Handoff and Graceful Degradation share regulatory roots, because a Minimum Risk Manoeuvre is what happens when a Handoff gets no response.
- **Eriksson & Stanton link.** It currently points to the HFES press release. Swap it for the journal DOI once you've pulled the paper.
- **Read first for learning:** Bainbridge (5 pages) and Klein et al. (5 pages). Both are short, and between them they cover the theory behind all five patterns.
