number: 4
name: "Appropriate Friction"
intent: "Before a high-stakes action, the interface asks the operator to slow down. A drone operator overriding a no-fly boundary has to hold the button for two seconds and confirm the zone, so a stray tap can’t send it there."

moment: before
trustJobs: [intervene, know]
risk: critical
reversibility: irreversible
autonomy: [1, 5]
domains: [drone, surgical, industrial]

The hard part is choosing which actions get it. A pause that shows up everywhere gets cleared from habit, and then it protects nothing. Reserve it for actions that cannot be undone, and make the confirmation name the specific consequence rather than asking whether the operator is sure.
