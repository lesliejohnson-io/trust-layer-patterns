    note: "Why a cold takeover fails even when the alarm works: skill and attention erode while the machine is driving. The orientation window has to be sized for an operator who has been out of the loop, not for one who never left it."

Timing is where this one usually goes wrong. A handoff triggered when the machine runs out of options is already too late, because the operator has been out of the loop and needs time to work out what is happening before they can act. Planned takeovers vary enormously in how long they take, so sizing the window from emergency data will leave people short.
