number: 6
name: "Intent Preview"
intent: "Before the machine acts, it shows what it is about to do, so a wrong plan is caught before it becomes a wrong action. A pilot sees the proposed route as a dashed line and checks it for unexpected turns before pressing execute."

moment: before
trustJobs: [know, intervene]
risk: critical
reversibility: irreversible
autonomy: [2, 5]
domains: [aviation, warehouse]

status: draft
updated: "2026-10-28"

steps:
  - title: "Plan staged"
    detail: "The change is held, not applied"
    note: "Mark the proposal as provisional. Boeing puts MOD in the page title and offers ERASE, so nobody reads a proposal as the current plan."
  - title: "Show the path"
    detail: "Route, destination, area it will sweep"
    key: true
  - title: "Human checks"
    detail: "Unexpected turns, loops or gaps"
    note: "The preview has to survive the check. At Cali the FMS dropped all intermediate fixes from its displays once a direct routing was executed."
  - title: "Commit or discard"
    detail: "Explicit execute, or erase"
  - title: "Act"
    detail: "The machine flies the plan that was seen"

with:
  steps: ["Plan staged", "Path shown", "Checked, then committed"]
  caption: "The proposal is visible while it is still only a proposal, so a wrong plan is caught before it becomes a wrong action."

    note: "Preview answers what the machine is about to do; friction answers how hard it should be to say go. Boeing's EXEC loop does both at once."

Investigators also faulted FMS logic that emptied the displays of intermediate fixes once a direct routing was executed, degrading the preview itself. 160 of 164 aboard died."

A preview only helps if it survives the check. At Cali the FMS dropped the intermediate fixes from its displays once the direct routing was executed, so the one picture that would have shown the turn toward terrain had already been emptied by the time anyone could look. The other half of the work is making the proposal unmistakably provisional: a staged change that looks identical to a live one invites the operator to read it as already true, and the pattern collapses back into Blind Execute. Where the machine moves through shared space rather than along a route page, the preview has to go where the people are — the Örebro forklift projects its path onto the floor, which is the same idea aimed at bystanders instead of at an operator.
