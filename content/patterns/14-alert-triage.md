intent: "Alerts are ranked by how urgently a human must act, and the ranking is visible in colour, position and sound, so the critical signal is not buried in a flood of equals."

review:
  - "Mechanism steps: drafted. Steps 2 and 3 carry sourced notes; the titles, details, and steps 4 and 5 are mine. Step 4 in particular — suppressing consequential alarms — is standard alarm-management practice but is not in the research."

openQuestions:
  - "The research asks for ISA-18.2, the process-industry alarm management standard, as a second interface example — closer to a warehouse or plant control room than a flight deck, and the place where alarm rationalisation and suppression are actually specified. It has not been pulled."
  - "Whether ranking survives contact with a cascade. Three levels work on a flight deck partly because the number of possible alerts is bounded and certified. A plant or a robot fleet can generate thousands, and at that point the ranking has to be computed rather than assigned in advance."

The detail that makes Three Mile Island more than a volume problem is the printer falling two and a half hours behind.[cite:nrc-printer] The alarms were not just too many to read; the record of them stopped being a record of the present. Whatever the operators were looking at had come loose from what the plant was doing, which is the state this pattern exists to prevent — and the operator's remark about throwing the panel away is what a display looks like once it has lost the ability to distinguish anything.[cite:tmi-commission]

The aviation answer is worth borrowing precisely because it is so unglamorous. Three levels, defined by what the crew must do and when.[cite:easa-cs25-1322] Colours that mean one thing and are not available for anything else. Two sensory channels for anything above Advisory. None of that is clever; it is a budget, spent in advance, on the assumption that attention is finite and the worst moment is when everything happens at once. The part most often skipped is the fourth step, suppressing the consequences of a fault so they do not arrive as peers of their own cause — which is the difference between a hundred alarms and one.
