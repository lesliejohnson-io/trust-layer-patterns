name: "Shared Mental Model"
intent: "The interface keeps what the human believes about the system’s state in sync with what that state actually is, so human and machine can predict each other."

moment: during
trustJobs: [predict, know]
risk: elevated
reversibility: costly
autonomy: [2, 5]
domains: [industrial, warehouse, surgical]

steps:
  - title: "Machine state"
    detail: "Mode, intent, next move"
  - title: "Externalize"
    detail: "Display, light, sound, motion cue"
    note: "Show intent before motion: where the machine will go next, not only where it is now."
  - title: "Human belief"
    detail: "Believed state, predicted move"
  - title: "Detect drift"
    detail: "Belief ≠ actual state"
    note: "Drift is caught both ways: the machine also models what the human expects it to do."
    key: true
  - title: "Resync"
    detail: "Correct, then confirm alignment"

without:
  steps: ["Robot moves", "Human assumes", "Near miss"]
  caption: "The human’s picture of the machine drifts from reality, and no one notices until something goes wrong."

with:
  steps: ["Intent shown", "Human predicts", "Coordinated work"]
  caption: "Each side can anticipate the other, so they share a workspace safely."

review:
  - "Unsourced claim: “a machine with no model of what the operator expects it to do cannot tell when that expectation has gone wrong”. The two-way sync is argued, not sourced: Sarter and Woods cover the operator's model diverging from the system's mode, not the reverse."

Showing the current state is not enough on its own, because a person working alongside a machine is always predicting its next move.[cite:endsley-1995] Signal intent before the motion starts, so that prediction has something to work from.[cite:klein-2004] The sync runs both ways as well: a machine with no model of what the operator expects it to do cannot tell when that expectation has gone wrong.
