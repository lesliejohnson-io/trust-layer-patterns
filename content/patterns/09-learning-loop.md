number: 9
name: "Learning Loop"
intent: "What operators notice in the field — oddities, near-misses, workarounds — is easy to report, reaches the people who can change the machine, and visibly leads to changes. This is how After feeds back into Before."

steps:
  - title: "Operator notices"
    detail: "An oddity, a near-miss, a workaround"
  - title: "Reporting is easy"
    detail: "Low effort, and no blame attached"
    note: "The ASRS is voluntary, confidential and non-punitive. NASA and the FAA set it up in 1975, with NASA holding the reports rather than the authority that enforces. Reporting has to cost less than staying quiet."
  - title: "It reaches who can change it"
    detail: "Engineering and training, not just the file"
    key: true
  - title: "Something changes"
    detail: "The machine, the procedure or the training"
  - title: "The loop closes visibly"
    detail: "Reporters can see what their report changed"
    note: "The ASRS feeds reports back out as safety alerts and CALLBACK, published monthly since 1979. A loop whose far end nobody can see stops being used."

antiPattern: "Reported and Forgotten"

without:
  steps: ["Crew learns something", "It goes in a log", "Next crew starts blind"]
  caption: "Reported and Forgotten: the knowledge stops at the record. The crew on the flight before JT610 met the same nose-down trim, cut out the stabilizer trim and landed — but that action was not entered in the maintenance log, and the next crew took off without it."

with:
  steps: ["Crew reports", "It reaches the engineers", "The machine or procedure changes"]
  caption: "The report travels, something changes because of it, and the people who file reports can see that it did."

    note: "Logged overrides are the richest input this loop has: repeated disagreement in the same situation is the clearest sign the machine is wrong."

    note: "Observed. Section 1.17.1.5.3.1 records nine incidents in the Air France A330/A340 fleet's air safety reports associated with unreliable indicated airspeeds between May 2008 and March 2009, all in cruise between FL310 and FL380, seven of which mentioned stall-warning activation. A note adds that after the accident Air France analysed recorded flight parameters and identified six further incidents that had never been raised in a report at all, whose maintenance write-ups described the characteristic symptoms only partially or not at all. Section 2.4 concludes that feedback from in-service events made it impossible to analyse the repeated failure to apply the unreliable-airspeed procedure in advance, and the causal factors name the feedback mechanisms that made it impossible to identify that repeated non-application and remedy it."

Intake runs at about 2,329 reports a week on data through December 2025. Reports come back out as safety alerts and CALLBACK, published monthly since 1979 — the visible far end of the loop, and the reason pilots keep filing."

    note: "CHI 2019. Guideline 15 is to encourage granular feedback during regular interaction — the intake half of this pattern, stated for software."

review:
  - "Mechanism steps: drafted. The research has definition, incidents and an interface example but no mechanism; the two step notes are sourced, the titles and details are not."
  - "Lion Air detail rests on two secondary reports (Leeham, AIN). The KNKT preliminary and final reports are the primary sources and have not been pulled."

openQuestions:
  - "The research files this as After → Before, which is the whole point of it, but a pattern carries exactly one moment in this library. It sits under After and over time, and the Before half shows up only in the prose."
  - "What closing the loop visibly actually takes. The ASRS publishes back to the whole profession rather than to the individual reporter, which may be why it works — but it is not obvious that per-reporter feedback would scale, or that it is what reporters want."

What stands out about both accidents is that the knowledge already existed. The crew on the flight before JT610 met the same nose-down trim, cut out the stabilizer trim and landed; what did not survive was the record of what they had done, so the next crew met it cold.[cite:leeham-jt610] Air France's A330/A340 fleet filed nine unreliable-airspeed reports between May 2008 and March 2009, and after AF447 the airline went back through recorded flight parameters and found six more incidents that had never been reported at all.[cite:bea-af447] The BEA's causal factors name the feedback mechanisms directly: they made it impossible to identify that crews were repeatedly not applying the procedure, and to remedy it.[cite:bea-af447]

So the hard part is not intake, it is the two ends. At the front, reporting has to cost less than silence, which is why the ASRS is confidential, non-punitive and sits with NASA rather than with the authority that could act on what it reads.[cite:asrs-briefing] At the back, something has to visibly change, and the people filing reports have to be able to see that it did. A loop whose far end is invisible is indistinguishable from a suggestion box, and it gets used like one.
