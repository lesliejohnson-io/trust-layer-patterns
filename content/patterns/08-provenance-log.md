  steps: ["Change applied", "No trace of who", "The operator carries it"]
  caption: "The Unseen Hand: the state changes and nothing records which party changed it. When the question is disputed later, the operator has only their word, and whoever built the system has everything else."

  steps: ["Change applied", "Actor recorded", "Responsibility traceable"]
  caption: "Every state change carries its author and its time. At Tempe the ADS data held the detection times, the successive classifications and the suppressed brake command, so the sequence could be established rather than argued."

    note: "Observed. NTSB/HAR-19/03. Section 1.5.6.1 sets out what the ADS data contained: when the system detected the pedestrian, how it classified her and predicted her path, vehicle dynamics, and the planned and executed actions. At the NTSB's request ATG supplied a playback of that data, and investigators built the event timeline from the sensor output. The table of recorded parameters carries the first detection at 5.6 seconds, the successive reclassifications, and the one-second action suppression that held off braking. The pattern working: the machine's own record is what made the sequence establishable afterwards."

At 3.24 the Chair finds it difficult to be precise about how many people were prosecuted and convicted on Horizon evidence, and puts the likely figure at approximately 1,000 across the United Kingdom; 3.25 adds that between 50 and 60 were prosecuted without being convicted. This volume covers human impact and redress only — it does not deal with remote access or the Fujitsu audit findings, which are left to volumes not yet published."

    note: "High-risk AI systems must technically allow the automatic recording of events over the system's lifetime, with logs supporting traceability appropriate to the system's purpose and deployers retaining them for at least six months. Not an interface, but the requirement an audit-trail view would be serving. Still the artificialintelligenceact.eu rendering: EUR-Lex refused automated retrieval of the Official Journal text of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, so both the article wording and which article the six-month period actually sits in are unconfirmed."

openQuestions:
  - "UN Regulation No. 157 is the other example this wants: the data storage requirement for automated driving, which obliges recording of activation, transition demands, overrides and minimum risk manoeuvres. EUR-Lex returned an empty response to every automated request, so none of it is confirmed and it is deliberately not cited yet."
  - "The remote-access claims still rest on news reports. Volume 1 of the Inquiry covers human impact and redress; remote access, the Jenkins evidence and the Ernst & Young findings belong to volumes still unpublished. The witness statements are on the Inquiry site and should replace the secondary sources once located."
  - "Who the log is for. A record sized for a later investigation is not the same artifact as one the operator can check the same day, and it is not obvious that one log can serve both."

Tempe is this pattern working, and it is worth being exact about why. The system recorded what it detected, how it reclassified the object as the seconds ran down, and the brake command it held back, so the sequence could be established afterwards from the machine's own account of itself rather than from anyone's recollection. The record outlived the event. That is the whole requirement.

Horizon is the cautionary half, and it fails somewhere more specific than it is usually remembered as failing. The Post Office maintained in court that branch accounts could not be changed remotely. Fujitsu engineers could in fact change them, and an engineer's evidence to the inquiry was that such a change need not look any different from the subpostmaster's own entry. None of that is a storage problem; the data was all there. A log the other party to a dispute can write to on the same footing as the operator is not evidence of anything, which is why the useful version of this pattern puts the record outside the reach of everyone who can change the state. The second requirement is easier to miss: the record has to be legible to the person whose work it describes, while they can still remember the day in question. A log that only an investigator reads, years later, protects the institution rather than the operator.
