number: 13
name: "Operator-to-Operator Handover"
intent: "When responsibility for a machine passes between people — shift change, remote operator to local — the system carries its true state across, including work in progress and anything disabled, rather than relying on memory and paper."

moment: transition

reversibility: irreversible

steps:
  - title: "Shift ends"
    detail: "Responsibility is about to move"
  - title: "Machine states its own condition"
    detail: "Mode, work in progress, what is disabled"
    note: "The disabled things are the dangerous ones. At Piper Alpha a pressure safety valve had been removed from condensate pump A and a blind flange fitted in its place, with the work unfinished at shift end."
  - title: "Structured, not freeform"
    detail: "The same fields every time"
  - title: "Receiver restates it"
    detail: "In their own words, back to the sender"
    key: true
    note: "I-PASS ends with synthesis by the receiver. In a nine-hospital study of 10,740 admissions, medical errors fell 23% and preventable adverse events 30%, without handoffs taking longer."
  - title: "Responsibility moves"
    detail: "Recorded, with both parties named"

antiPattern: "Lost at Shift Change"

without:
  steps: ["Work unfinished", "Handover by memory", "Next shift acts blind"]
  caption: "Lost at Shift Change: the permits for the pump work and the valve work were separate and not cross-referenced. That night the other pump failed, and the night shift restarted pump A without knowing its safety valve was missing."

with:
  steps: ["State assembled", "Receiver restates it", "Responsibility recorded"]
  caption: "The machine's real condition travels with the responsibility, and the receiver has to say it back before it is theirs."

review:
  - "Risk (critical): drafted, not from the research."
  - "Reversibility (irreversible): drafted, not from the research."
  - "Autonomy ([1, 4]): drafted. Piper Alpha was barely automated at all, so this range is about where the pattern applies rather than where the evidence sits. Not from the research."
  - "Mechanism steps: drafted. Steps 2 and 4 carry sourced notes; the five-step shape, the titles and details are mine."
  - "Related links (handoff, provenance-log): inferred, not from the research."
  - "Open question 2: drafted. The research's Open item is the warehouse question, carried as the first open question."
  - "Every Piper Alpha claim is secondary. The Cullen Report (1990) is the primary source and has not been pulled; one of the three citations is a trade-news article and another is an aviation magazine quoting the report."
  - "The I-PASS figures come from the AHRQ PSNet record and a hospital press release, not from the NEJM paper (Starmer et al., N Engl J Med 2014;371:1803-12). Pull the paper before these numbers leave draft."
  - "Domains: industrial only. Piper Alpha was a fixed offshore installation, tagged industrial rather than maritime; I-PASS is a hospital, which has no domain in the schema and so adds no tag. The research's warehouse example does not exist yet."
  - "Death toll (167) is in the research and deliberately left out of the entry. Decide whether it belongs."

openQuestions:
  - "The warehouse case the research asks for: what an incoming fleet operator should see about robots that are paused, in maintenance, or running with a sensor disabled. The Piper Alpha lesson says the disabled things need to be the loudest item on the screen, but nobody seems to build the handover view that way."
  - "Whether the receiver's restatement survives being software. I-PASS works partly because a person has to say it out loud to another person; a checkbox that says the same thing is the kind of control that gets cleared from habit."

The structural detail in Piper Alpha is the one worth carrying: the permits for the pump work and the valve work existed, and were separate, and were not cross-referenced. Nobody lost the information. The system simply had no way to put two facts next to each other — this pump is being worked on, this pump's safety valve is gone — and the handover depended on somebody holding both at once. Lord Cullen's finding was not that a step was skipped but that there was no clear procedure for shift handovers at all, and that the permit system was habitually departed from.

What I-PASS adds is the receiver's half. Most handover design concentrates on what the outgoing operator says, which is the easier problem; the hard one is whether the incoming operator has actually built the picture. Making the receiver synthesise it back is a check on the transfer rather than on the sender, and the nine-hospital result suggests it is cheap — the errors fell and the handoffs did not get longer. For a machine the equivalent is not a summary screen. It is being made to state what you think you have just taken charge of, including what on it is switched off.
